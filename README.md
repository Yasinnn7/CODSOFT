## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Task 1: rock, paper, scissors.
✅ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game – Task 4 Summary

🔹 User Interaction: Prompted user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors with clear instructions.

🔹 Random Computer Move: Used Python’s random module to generate computer’s choice.

🔹 Game Logic: Implemented rules to determine the winner:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beat Paper

Paper beats Rock

🔹 Result Display: Clearly showed both user’s and computer’s choices and the outcome (Win/Lose/Tie).

🔹 Score Tracking (Optional Feature): Maintained and displayed scores for both user and computer over multiple rounds.

🔹 Replay Option: Included a feature to play multiple rounds based on user input.

🔹 User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simple text-based UI for easy understanding and engagement.

### 🔹 Task 2: ✅ To-Do List Application – Project Summary

🛠️ Project Goal: Developed a Python-based To-Do List application to help users manage and organize daily tasks efficiently.

💻 Interface: Built as a command-line or GUI-based application for better usability and flexibility.

➕ Core Features:

Add new tasks

View and list all tasks

Update existing tasks

Mark tasks as completed

Delete tasks

📦 Data Handling: Used file handling or simple database (e.g., JSON or SQLite) to store and retrieve tasks persistently.

✅ User-Friendly: Focused on clear instructions and intuitive user interaction.

🚀 Learning Outcome: Strengthened understanding of Python, data structures, and CRUD operations.


### 🔹 Task 3:
🧮 Simple Python Calculator – Mini Project
I recently built a basic calculator in Python using the if-elif structure and exception handling. 🚀

🔹 Key Features:

Accepts user input for two numbers

Offers operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Handles invalid input and division by zero gracefully

Supports both numeric and symbol-based operation choices (e.g. 1 or +)

🔍 This project demonstrates:

Clean input/output handling

Python’s try-except block for robust user interaction

Foundational logic building for bigger applications

💡 Perfect for beginners exploring Python fundamentals!
