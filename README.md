# Rock 🪨 Paper 📄  Scissors ✂️ Game
🚀 Project Spotlight: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Task 4) 🎮

Excited to share a fun and engaging project I recently completed — a Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using Python! This project may seem simple on the surface, but it taught me the importance of structuring logic, handling user input, and creating an interactive, user-friendly experience.

🔹 Key Features:

⋆ Real-time user input and random computer selection

⋆ Game logic to determine the winner (Rock 🪨 beats Scissors ✂️, Scissors beats Paper 📄, and Paper beats Rock)

⋆ Displays both user and computer choices, along with the result (Win, Lose, Tie)

⋆ Score tracking for multiple rounds

⋆ Option to play again, making it dynamic and replayable

⋆ Clear, user-centric interface for a smooth gameplay experience
